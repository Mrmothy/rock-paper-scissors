# Basic Python Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.

## A functional rock, paper, scissors game on your ability to try and beat the (import random) statement. This program allows you to pick between either rock, paper or scissors and see if your pick beats the computer's pick. 

This program is an example that was built along with a Learn Python app I was using on my journey to learning how to program in python. This program is a sample code which shows how to use the following:

- Using the import random statement
- Getting the users input on a option of three choices
- Using if and while statements 
- Using functions and calling on the function
- Using f-strings
- Creating and using a dictionary to hold answers 

##  How to use this program on your own
I'd encourage you to clone and use this program in whatever IDE you feel comfortable using.
